# üõ°Ô∏è Windows Threat Audit & Cleanup Automation Scripts

This project includes PowerShell scripts that enhance security visibility and hygiene on a Windows system. These tools support a proactive cybersecurity posture by surfacing common persistence mechanisms, startup anomalies, and system clutter.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

```
C:\Scripts\
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Threat-Audit.ps1                # Performs a system audit with security focus
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Register-ThreatAuditTask.ps1    # Registers the audit script as a scheduled task
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Clean-TempFolder.ps1            # (Optional) Manual temp cleanup utility
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Logs\                           # Stores timestamped audit logs
```

## üîç Threat-Audit.ps1

### üéØ Purpose

Performs a comprehensive local system threat audit covering:

- PowerShell Execution Policy and Logging
- Registry-based autoruns (HKCU + HKLM)
- Non-Microsoft scheduled tasks
- Auto-start services
- Open TCP connections
- Temporary folder contents

---

### üíª Script

```powershell
<#
.SYNOPSIS
Performs a system threat audit and saves results to a timestamped log file.

.DESCRIPTION
Checks PowerShell execution policies, script block logging, auto-start entries, scheduled tasks,
auto-start services, active TCP connections, and temp folder size.

.OUTPUT
Creates a timestamped log file in C:\Scripts\Logs\

## ‚è∞ Register-ThreatAuditTask.ps1

### üéØ Purpose

Registers the `Threat-Audit.ps1` script to run every Monday at **8:05 AM**, with ‚ÄúRun task as soon as possible after a scheduled start is missed‚Äù enabled.

---

### üíª Script

```powershell
<#
.SYNOPSIS
Registers a scheduled task to run Threat-Audit.ps1 weekly.

.DESCRIPTION
Creates a scheduled task named 'ThreatAuditWeekly' that runs every Monday at 8:05 AM.
If the system is off, it runs at next startup.

$taskName = "ThreatAuditWeekly"

## üßπ Clean-TempFolder.ps1 (use with caution or perform manually)

### üéØ Purpose

Deletes all files and subfolders inside the current user's temp directory. Use cautiously in production.

---

### üíª Script

```powershell
<#
.SYNOPSIS
Deletes all files and folders from the user TEMP directory.

.DESCRIPTION
This is a hygiene cleanup script to reduce clutter and possible persistence hiding spots.

Write-Host "üßπ Cleaning Temp Folder: $env:TEMP" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Get-ChildItem "$env:TEMP" -Recurse -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Remove-Item -Force -Recurse -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Write-Host "‚úÖ Temp folder cleaned." -ForegroundColor Green
```

## üí° Cybersecurity Rationale

- **Startup entries**, scheduled tasks, and services are **common persistence vectors**.
- **Execution policy and logging** are essential for catching script-based attacks.
- **Temp folders** are used by malware and LOLBins to hide payloads.
- Frequent audits increase situational awareness and reduce dwell time.

---

## ‚úÖ Usage Tips

- Place all `.ps1` files inside `C:\Scripts\`
- Logs are written to `C:\Scripts\Logs\`
- Run the task registration script once to automate weekly audits
- Pair with Sysmon, Defender, and your ELK/SIEM stack for maximum visibility
