# 🛡️ Windows Threat Audit & Cleanup Automation Scripts

This project includes PowerShell scripts that enhance security visibility and hygiene on a Windows system. These tools support a proactive cybersecurity posture by surfacing common persistence mechanisms, startup anomalies, and system clutter.

## 🔍 Threat-Audit.ps1

### 🎯 Purpose

Performs a comprehensive local system threat audit covering:

- PowerShell Execution Policy and Logging
- Registry-based autoruns (HKCU + HKLM)
- Non-Microsoft scheduled tasks
- Auto-start services
- Open TCP connections
- Temporary folder contents

---

### 💻 Script

```powershell
<#
.SYNOPSIS
Performs a system threat audit and saves results to a timestamped log file.

.DESCRIPTION
Checks PowerShell execution policies, logging status, autoruns, scheduled tasks, services, TCP connections, and temp folder usage.

.USAGE
Run manually in an elevated PowerShell session.

## ⏰ Register-ThreatAuditTask.ps1

### 🎯 Purpose

Registers the `Threat-Audit.ps1` script to run every Monday at **8:05 AM**, with “Run task as soon as possible after a scheduled start is missed” enabled.

---

### 💻 Script

```powershell
<#
.SYNOPSIS
Registers a scheduled task to run Threat-Audit.ps1 weekly using PowerShell 7 (pwsh.exe)

.DESCRIPTION
Creates a scheduled task named 'ThreatAuditWeekly' that runs every Monday at 8:05 AM using pwsh.exe.
Ensures it runs as SYSTEM with highest privileges, and re-runs at startup if missed.

$taskName   = "ThreatAuditWeekly"
$scriptPath = "C:\Scripts\Threat-Audit.ps1"
$time       = "08:05AM"
$days       = "Monday"

# Use PowerShell 7 executable
$pwshPath = "$env:ProgramFiles\PowerShell\7\pwsh.exe"

# Validate pwsh exists
if (-not (Test-Path $pwshPath)) {
    Write-Error "⚠️ pwsh.exe not found at $pwshPath. Is PowerShell 7 installed?"
    return
}

# Set action using PowerShell 7
$action = New-ScheduledTaskAction -Execute $pwshPath -Argument "-NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File `"$scriptPath`""

# Set trigger to weekly on selected day/time
$trigger = New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -Weekly -DaysOfWeek $days -At $time
$trigger.StartBoundary = ([datetime]::Now).Date.AddHours(8).AddMinutes(5).ToString("s")
$trigger.Enabled = $true

# Register the task
Register-ScheduledTask -Action $action -Trigger $trigger -TaskName $taskName -Description "Weekly Threat Audit using pwsh.exe" -User "SYSTEM" -RunLevel Highest -Force

# Output status
Get-ScheduledTask -TaskName $taskName | Select-Object TaskPath, TaskName, State
Write-Host "✅ Scheduled task '$taskName' successfully created to run with PowerShell 7." -ForegroundColor Green
```

## 📝 Logging Behavior

The `Threat-Audit.ps1` script handles all logging internally. It creates a **timestamped log file** for every run in the `Logs` subfolder, using the format:

```
ThreatAudit_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.txt
```

📂 Example:
```
C:\Scripts\Logs\
├── ThreatAudit_20250715_233247.txt
├── ThreatAudit_20250716_000459.txt
```

You do **not** need to use output redirection — logging is handled by `Start-Transcript`.

---

## 🧹 Clean-TempFolder.ps1 (use with caution or perform manually)

### 🎯 Purpose

Deletes all files and subfolders inside the current user's temp directory. Use cautiously in production.

---

### 💻 Script

```powershell
<#
.SYNOPSIS
Deletes all files and folders from the user TEMP directory.

.DESCRIPTION
This is a hygiene cleanup script to reduce clutter and possible persistence hiding spots.

Write-Host "🧹 Cleaning Temp Folder: $env:TEMP" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Get-ChildItem "$env:TEMP" -Recurse -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Remove-Item -Force -Recurse -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Write-Host "✅ Temp folder cleaned." -ForegroundColor Green
```

## 💡 Cybersecurity Rationale

- **Startup entries**, scheduled tasks, and services are **common persistence vectors**.
- **Execution policy and logging** are essential for catching script-based attacks.
- **Temp folders** are used by malware and LOLBins to hide payloads.
- Frequent audits increase situational awareness and reduce dwell time.

---

## ✅ Usage Tips

- Place all `.ps1` files inside `C:\Scripts\`
- Logs are written to `C:\Scripts\Logs\`
- Run the task registration script once to automate weekly audits
- Pair with Sysmon, Defender, and your ELK/SIEM stack for maximum visibility

🧠 Created for defenders, students, and sysadmins looking to bring transparency to their Windows environment.
