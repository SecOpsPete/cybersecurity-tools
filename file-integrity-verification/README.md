# 🧪 File Integrity Verification Using SHA256 Hash (Wireshark Example)

This guide walks through how to verify the **integrity** of a downloaded file using a SHA256 checksum. Verifying file integrity ensures the file hasn’t been tampered with or corrupted during download — a critical part of secure software practices.

---

## 📦 Example Files

- `Wireshark-win64-4.4.6.exe` — the file to verify  
- `Wireshark-win64-4.4.6.exe.sha256` — the official file containing the published hashes from the [Wireshark download page](https://www.wireshark.org/download.html)

---

## 🧰 Prerequisites

- The downloaded `.exe` file  
- The corresponding `.sha256` file from the official source  
- PowerShell (preinstalled on Windows)

---

## ⚙️ Step-by-Step Instructions (PowerShell)

## ⚙️ PowerShell Instructions for Verifying SHA256 Hash

### ⚙️ Follow these PowerShell commands step-by-step to verify the integrity of your downloaded Wireshark installer:

1. 📂 **Navigate to the folder containing your downloaded files**

    ```powershell
    cd "$env:USERPROFILE\Downloads"
    ```

2. 🔍 **Confirm the installer is in the directory**

    ```powershell
    ls *.exe
    ```

3. 📖 **Manually copy the official SHA256 hash from wireshark.org/download.html**

    ```powershell
    $officialHash = "d1925b045300c34ea8082b7ec0d79aeae31edf01eb9fdd9b69e069ece785ca93"
    ```

4. 🧮 **Compute the SHA256 hash of the downloaded installer**

    ```powershell
    $myHash = (Get-FileHash .\Wireshark-win64-4.4.6.exe -Algorithm SHA256).Hash
    ```

5. 📄 **Extract the official hash from the `.sha256` file content**

    ```powershell
    $officialHash = (Get-Content .\Wireshark-win64-4.0.10.exe.sha256).Split(" ")[0]
    ```

6. ✅ **Compare your computed hash with the official hash**

Use this PowerShell snippet to compare your computed SHA256 hash with the official hash and get a clear success or failure message:

```powershell
if ($myHash -eq $officialHash) {
    Write-Host "`n✅ Hashes match. File integrity verified." -ForegroundColor Green
} else {
    Write-Host "`n❌ Hash mismatch. File may be corrupted or tampered with." -ForegroundColor Red
}
```

**Note:** Replace file names with the exact versions you downloaded if different.

## 🧠 Why File Integrity Verification Matters

Checking a file’s hash is a key step in any secure download process. It confirms the file was not altered, corrupted, or replaced before execution.

---

### 🔍 Key Benefits

- 🧪 **Detects corruption** — Ensures the file wasn’t damaged during download (e.g., incomplete or interrupted transfer)  
- 🧨 **Prevents tampering** — Protects against malicious modifications from compromised mirrors or supply chain attacks  
- 🛡️ **Confirms authenticity** — When no digital signature is available, a hash check still ensures the file is genuine  

---

### 📌 Real-World Use Cases

- ✅ Verifying open-source tools from GitHub or vendor sites  
- ✅ Validating incident response toolkits before execution  
- ✅ Ensuring forensic evidence files remain unaltered during transfer

Hash verification is a foundational skill for cybersecurity professionals and an essential habit in secure software workflows.
